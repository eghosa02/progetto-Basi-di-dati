# University Meteorological Database Project

This repository contains an SQL-based university project for simulating data collection for meteorological companies. The project aims to provide a database schema and sample data for storing meteorological information gathered by various sensors and instruments.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a database system that can store meteorological data collected by different stations operated by meteorological companies. The system should support efficient data retrieval, analysis, and reporting for meteorological research and forecasting purposes.

## Features

- **Data Schema:** Defines a structured schema for storing meteorological data including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.
- **Station Management:** Allows for the management of meteorological stations including their locations, operational status, and equipment.
- **Data Collection:** Supports the recording of meteorological observations from different stations at regular intervals.
